## OnSite/EPT Signals
### Description
There is an EPT signal in the room. What is it trying to tell you?

flag = flag.replace("(", "{").replace(")", "}").replace("-", "_").upper()

### Solution
We filmed the sign with a video camera and manually recreated the moorse signal. Decoding this moorse code gave us the flag.

Why do it the engineering way when you can do it the easy way. 


### Flag
`EPT{WELL_DONE_MORSE_IS_C00L}`
